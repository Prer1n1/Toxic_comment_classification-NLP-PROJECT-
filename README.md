# Toxic_comment_classification-NLP-PROJECT-
This project presents a proposed system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to detect and classify toxic comments. The proposed system will use a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods to train a model that can accurately detect and classify toxic comments. The model will be trained on a large dataset of comments from various online sources, and the results will be evaluated using a variety of metrics.
